# Shopify-Allazo

I designed and implemented a real-world project for a clothing designer, leveraging my expertise in Shopify's customization capabilities. Utilizing the platform's built-in customization editor, I established the website's foundation without delving into extensive code writing. Subsequently, I delved into the code, manipulating CSS and the liquid templating language to introduce captivating animations. Examples include orchestrating images to slide from opposite sides of the screen, dynamically altering button and text properties upon user hover, and overriding product image code for a visually striking effect against the black backdrop.

To enhance user engagement, I crafted features such as a marquee with scrolling text for exclusive clothing drops and a countdown timer that dynamically zooms into focus, instilling a sense of urgency. On the "All Products" page, I replaced pagination with continuous loading, offering a seamless experience as users scroll down.

Moreover, I implemented a sticky navigation bar that elegantly disappears when users scroll down and reappears upon scrolling up. To add a finishing touch, I integrated a clickable rotating animation on the website's logo, providing users with a convenient way to return to the homepage. Thank you, enjoy!
